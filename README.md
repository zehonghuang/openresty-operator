**OpenResty Operator** is a lightweight Kubernetes controller for managing and deploying OpenResty instances in a declarative way. It organizes configurations like `location`, `upstream`, and `server` through CRDs, enabling unified proxy control for third-party APIs.

This project is independently developed and maintained by me, driven by a recurring pain point Iâ€™ve encountered in real-world projects:

In many small to mid-sized companies or development teams, businesses rely heavily on external APIs. However, existing gateway solutions tend to have the following downsides:

- **High resource overhead**: For example, APISIX relies on etcd as a configuration store. While powerful, it increases system complexity and resource consumption.
- **Complex operations and steep learning curve**: Tools like Kong and APISIX include an Admin API that requires additional authentication setup and, often, custom development to match specific business needs.
- **Limited customizability or over-abstraction**: These solutions often hide core behaviors behind plugins, which makes fine-grained control harder to achieve.

## Why OpenResty + Operator?

This project aims to provide an **infrastructure-friendly** alternative by:

- **Staying close to native Nginx configuration**: All logic is defined at the raw configuration level, fully aligned with OpenResty/Nginx syntax, ensuring full transparency and control.
- **Modular abstraction via CRDs**: Resources like `Location`, `ServerBlock`, and `Upstream` are modeled as independent CRDs with clearly defined relationships and version control.
- **Native Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with GitOps tools like ArgoCD and Flux.
- **Minimal dependencies, production ready**: Requires only the OpenResty image and this Operatorâ€”no etcd or additional services.

## Key Features

- **Flexible configuration modeling**  
  Uses CRDs to represent Nginx structures like `Location`, `ServerBlock`, and `Upstream`. Especially useful for managing large sets of third-party APIs that are distributed and hard to maintain.

- **Automated configuration rendering and deployment**  
  Automatically combines configuration blocks to generate the final `nginx.conf` and deploys it as an OpenResty instance.

- **Hot-reload on configuration change**  
  Includes a built-in reload agent to apply configuration changes without restarting the container.

- **Reference validation and version tracking**  
  CRD relationships are version-aware and readiness-checked to ensure consistent and traceable references.

- **Built-in observability**  
  Exposes Prometheus metrics out-of-the-box to visualize upstream health and configuration status.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Operator

**Recommended**: install via Helm.

```bash
helm repo add openresty-operator https://huangzehong.me/openresty-operator
helm install openresty openresty-operator/openresty-operator
```

Alternatively, install from source using raw manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/
kubectl apply -k config/smaples/
```

### 2. Define configuration CRDs

A basic example of `Location`, `ServerBlock`, and `Upstream`:

```yaml
apiVersion: openresty.huangzehong.me/v1alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: location-sample
spec:
  entries:
    - path: /sample-api/
      proxyPass: http://upstream-sample/
      enableUpstreamMetrics: true
      headers:
        - key: Host
          value: $host
        - key: X-Real-IP
          value: $remote_addr
        - key: X-Forwarded-For
          value: $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for
        - key: X-Forwarded-Proto
          value: $scheme
        - key: X-Content-Type-Options
          value: nosniff
        - key: Access-Control-Allow-Origin
          value: "*"
      accessLog: false
---
apiVersion: openresty.huangzehong.me/v1alpha1
kind: ServerBlock
metadata:
  name: serverblock-sample
spec:
  listen: "80"
  locationRefs:
    - location-sample
---
apiVersion: openresty.huangzehong.me/v1alpha1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  name: upstream-sample
spec:
  servers:
    - example.com:80
    - www.baidu.com:443
    - invalid.domain.local:8080
```

### 3. Create an OpenResty instance

```yaml
apiVersion: openresty.huangzehong.me/v1alpha1
kind: OpenResty
metadata:
  name: openresty-sample
spec:
  image: gintonic1glass/openresty:with-prometheus
  http:
    include:
      - mime.types
    logFormat: |
      $remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" ...
    clientMaxBodySize: 16m
    gzip: true
    extra:
      - sendfile on;
      - tcp_nopush on;
    serverRefs:
      - serverblock-sample
    upstreamRefs:
      - upstream-sample
  metrics:
    enable: true
    listen: "8080"
    path: "/metrics"
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics and Observability

OpenResty Operator exports a range of Prometheus metrics to help monitor config status and traffic health. It's compatible with standard observability stacks like Prometheus + Grafana:

- `openresty_crd_ref_status`: Track cross-CRD references and readiness (e.g., ServerBlock â†’ Location).
- `openresty_upstream_dns_ready`: Report DNS resolution status of upstream servers.
- `openresty_request_total`, `openresty_response_status`: Analyze traffic volume and HTTP code distributions.
- Business-level metrics can be extended via embedded Lua blocks.

## ðŸ“Š Grafana Dashboard Preview

OpenResty Operator metrics can be visualized via Grafana. Below is an example panel showing:

- CRD instance counts and readiness status
- Upstream DNS health and response rates
- Recent config validation errors and alerts (e.g., path collisions, DNS failures)
